also aesthetic features such facial attractiveness have with viewing time however what knownabout the relation between viewing time and the experience art although empirical aesthetics the second

only few studies have examined the relation between and viewing time with regard the perception art research art museums showed that the number artworksin exhibition room affects viewing time viewing timecommonly decreases over the course the exhibition aphenomena calledmuseum fatigue for overview see and the average time spent viewing artworks generally short smith and smith recorded how long people viewed six thepaintings the permanent collection the art containing over million objects they reportedplos one www plosone org june volume issue median viewing time seconds mean seconds around percent the looks lasted less than seconds onequarter one third the looks lasted around half minute andonly percent the looks lasted longer than minute moreover mean viewing time significantly differed amongartworks and participants suggesting that both artwork and personal characteristics affect viewing time however smith and smith performed their manual chronometry and they did not collect data aboutpeoplea subjective experience each artwork heidenreich andturanoa study aimed overcome these limitations theyanalyzed the correlation between viewing time and art experience and they measured viewing time and eye movement patterns witha head mounted eye tracker while participants solely viewed selected artworks exhibited museum participants were askedto rate each artwork pleasantness interestingness beauty power clarity and orderliness similar smith and smith theyfound large individual differences with viewing times ranging from seconds surprisingly however viewing time did correlate with any the art experience scales thiswould imply that contrast other types visual stimuli viewing time for artworks not related subjective experience however due the small sample size the these results limited and has taken with caution nevertheless these museum studies suggest that average viewingtime for artworks around seconds with large variationsamong people and artworks the relation between viewing timeand the experience art however remains unclear context and the experience artart always experienced specific context the semanticcontext created providing certain information such artworktitle art historical facts about authenticity has appreciable effects peoplea response and evaluation ofart well the underlying neural processes contrast these semantic context effects only few studieshave investigated the effect physical context local scale the near physical context are other surrounding artworks whichcan lead contrast and assimilation effects physical contexton larger scale includes the space which artworks arepresented typically museums galleries exhibition rooms ofprivate collectors with variable interior designs big small roomswith white rather colorful walls this physical context isimportant for the classification object work art moreover all subsequent cognitive and emotional art perception are always embedded context thus different physical contexts might lead differences inaesthetic processing psychological research the perception ofart however has mostly been conducted the laboratory context experiments laboratories enable researchers factors while controlling for confounding variables thislaboratory approach has increased our knowledge about mechanisms involved the experience art but what extent are these results generalizable real worldsituations how does the experience art the laboratory andthe museum differ locher smith and smith showed that pictorial featuressuch symmetry complexity were evaluated similar

artworks were liked more andfound more interesting the museum context the otherhand the evaluation ambiguity did not differ between contextsand the sense understanding only tended higher themuseum this suggests that the museum context those aspects art experience that are more closelylinked with emotion liking and interest although most studiesthat investigated emotional experiences during art perception wereactually conducted the laboratory context our that emotional responses art may stronger moreusual settings our results are well line with previous findings whichreported higher interestingness and pleasantness ratings fororiginal artworks the museum compared digital reproduc tions presented laboratory computer screen nadal brieber and leder obtained similar results using within subject design and also found that artworks the museum wereliked more found more interesting and experienced morepositive and arousing thus although these studies wereconducted several museums using different artworks anddifferent experimental designs between and within subject theyall support the notion that there enhanced art experience inthe museum among several factors that might contribute this enhancedart experience the museum peoplea aesthetic attitude whilebeholding artwork and the authenticity the artwork itselfmight play decisive role the museum context enhances theartistic status the exhibited objects and consequently facilitates the adoption aesthetic orientation associated withincreased affective processing the museum visitors with anaesthetic orientation encounter genuine artworks authenticity isan important factor increasing the monetary value andaesthetic evaluation art remains unclear however whether the physical context the authenticity the artwork aninteraction between them determines the enhanced art experiencein the museum therefore further studies are required todisentangle the effects physical context and authenticity artexperience context modulates the relation between art experienceand viewing timeour analyses demonstrate that there relationship betweenpeoplea experience art and how much time they choose viewart and reading the labels furthermore the relationship betweenviewing time and art experience was modulated context thesecontext effects show that over and above quantitative differencesin viewing time and art experience between contexts under laboratory conditions are not necessarily trans ferable other settings additionally building researchwhich found that art specific information affects appreciation our analysis predicting viewing time for labels offers anexplanation which factors actually drive information seeking hereafter discuss how the predictors main interesta appreciation ambiguity and understandinga affect viewing timefor artworks and labels both contexts viewing time for artworks and labels increasedwith appreciation liking and interest the strength however tended vary with context peoplea sappreciation showed slightly stronger relationship with viewingtime for artworks and labels the laboratory than the museumcontext thus appreciation based liking and more important predictor viewing time thelaboratory than the museum context this suggests that longerviewing times for artworks the museum context cannot beexplained enhanced appreciation alone additional factorssuch ambiguity need considered has been argued that ambiguity important aspect ofaesthetic experience our results showed however that theeffect ambiguity time spent viewing artworks between contexts while there was positive relationbetween ambiguity and viewing time the museum participantsin the laboratory showed negative relationship this isparticularly interesting relation the finding that participantsin the museum and the laboratory did not differ how theyevaluated ambiguity thus although peoplea experience ofambiguity might similar different contexts its impact onpeoplea viewing behavior differs the museum context promotesthat people engage with and delve into the ambiguity artworksand invest more time resolving while the the point time where people decide refocus theirattention another artwork comes sooner for the moreambiguous artworks therefore the museum context changeshow ambiguity affects peoplea exploration behavior similar the effects appreciation understanding predicted viewing time for artworks both contexts increased understanding was related increase viewing timefor artworks however the subjective impression artista work was not related the

understanding expected apositive relationship between understanding and viewing time forlabels one possible explanation for our finding could that thelabels this exhibition were not informative enough and thus people did not benefit from reading thetext information the lack the relation between viewing time for labels however remains unclear and needsfurther studies our general finding that art experience positively related toviewing time differs from heidenreich and turanoa who didnot find any significant correlations our analysis suggests that artappreciation less strongly related viewing time the museumthan laboratory context given that heidenreich and turanocollected their data the museum with small sample only likely that these differing findings occur becausetheir analysis was underpowered most studies the field empirical aesthetics thecurrent study only recruited psychology students whose see the artworks uncertain this homogeneous samples with regards factors such asage socioeconomic status and education and facilitates thecontrol the level art expertise nevertheless further studiesshould conducted with spontaneous art museum visitors raise the level ecological validity and enlargeour knowledge about art experience the museum aesthetics has mostly focused how stimulus orpersonal factors contribute the appreciation art our that context affects the experience

theory introductionin studying narrative theories that have been developedover the years cinematic theatrical literary search one predictably nds that narrative theories havedrawn upon each other reach specii goals ourstarting point was consider every narrative theorythat presents any relevant aspect for narrative dei tion however assessing narrative their relevance narrative approach tovr proves fairly challenging one big issue liesin nding common ground between theories thatthey can considered analysed and compared acomparative approach the characteristics dii erentmedia appeared reasonable similar approach nar rative theories seems much more questionable thespectrum abstraction which they rely such that for instance direct comparison between aristotelianand structuralist narrative considerations would ndlittle use for constructing narrative theory particularto thus coni ourselves considering the rele vance each separately theory for startwith concepts from platoa high

both thenarrative theories under consideration and the vari ous media including locate diegetic theoriesand narrative forms tellinga the tradition original greek drama least the chorus and substantially the novel and mimetic forms andtheories showinga present the forms theatreor cinema such categorisation allows representation structure process the visual aspects may suggest that shouldgive more priority mimetic considerations againstdiegetic ones however potentially both can make apositive contribution consider them equally table comparative table ofdii erent narrative forms cinema theatre literature vrcontingency ontime and spacelow medium low visual mental visualpresence not physical physical not physical not physical but immersive interactivity yes the case yes mimetic and diegetic considerations and vrthe community the last few years has beenstrongly ini uenced the aristotelian approach tonarrative and has recently produced signii cant workbased those conceptions however aristotlea splot centred approach does not include the author and the user possible factor orcomponent the narrative and this makes hard toapply without serious modii cation hence mateasdescribes his approach neo aristotleana plotcentred approach coni icts with the freedom poten tially ers the user and can therefore veryrestrictive order reconcile interactivity and nar rative while still providing the user with freedom within environment aylett wellas nath argue for the consideration char acter based narrative form this presents the doubleadvantage for the user the one hand taking partin unique experience and the other acting freelywithout the constraints imposed plot centred proach theatre and cinema clearly work largely from metic perspective sharing particular awareness thespectatora visual engagement cinema and theoristshave added the general aristotelian conception ofmimesis for example including the conception ofnarration from dii erent perspectives emphasise dra matic structure the camera can then thought asa observer ideally mobile space and timea aninvisible observer however bordwell argues thatthese approaches only partially cover the other techniques these theories have had substantial impact ontechnical aspects cinematography through the use ofparticular camera angles and positions but their con tribution the theory sought for more prob lematic cinema the camera under that the ideal observer represents somesense the narrator the camera identii withthe user and removing their control over the freedom move and look that one ofthe major dei ning characteristics the medium thissense moves beyond mimesis showinga with itsimplication direction experiencinga thus though both cinema and share synthetic visualaspect there are fundamental dii erences between themwhich make the narrative theory much less usefulthan one might have assumed given that aristotle gives little theoretical weight tothe role emotion narrative distinct from itsemotional impact upon the spectator not surpris ing that the subsequent theories already mentioned donot pay any particular attention emotion and itsvalues now believed that emotions play impor tant role human cognition and are major factor inthe establishment believability narrative the ory for must encompass the emotional contributionto believability which contributes towards

during experimentthe diversity audience behaviour also observed brushstroke level figure shows the eye orientation for four different brushstrokes with data from participants sepa rated colour many brushstrokes were viewed the participants from different angles individual participants also looked the same brushstrokes multiple times from surmise that this can attributed combination the inherent quali ties artwork and free audience movements around through objects whichencourages more exploration and diverse viewing angles how the artist interactions via design choices such composition colour texture for instance some brushstrokes are partially visible from angle such that participants need changetheir location discover occluded content this further continued where shape and light ing configuration also allow some brushstrokes change their appearance when viewedfrom different angles the data showed that the participants encountered different colours the vrpainting understand this further studied how different participants explored thosecolours and whether there were different preferences colour gender figure depicts the number colours seen each participant their viewing

performance indicatesa strong link between the tracked user behaviour patterns and the associated such gender art knowledge aim comparing the performance three typical neural network structures feed forward dense network fdn convolutional neural network cnn and long shortterm memory lstm keras and tensorflow are the frameworks chosen for the the fdn takes six inputs and concatenates them before

different data ranges and scales the datais normalised for each the six measurements because strict rule was not placed onhow long viewing session should some participants spent more time than others forsession based models the input data from all participants must the same shape therefore the first focus events when participants started gazing brushstroke weresampled from each participant for the

guidelines for future creation technological tool used for helping people examine their own thoughts and emotions this study describes nine active and proficient lucid dreamersa representations their introspective experiences gained through interviews four major themes emerged sensations and feelings actions and practices influences experience and meaning making this knowledge can help design system that grounded genuine experience and preserving the human condition author keywords virtual reality design lucid dreaming introspection well being positive technologies acm classification keywords information interfaces and presentation hci miscellaneous introduction technology becoming more and more ingrained our every day lives yet only recently that hci researchers technologists and designers have paused think about how these technologies could used better our lives and increase our well being while many mobile applications designed for this purpose exist one area that still largely unexplored virtual reality offers low cost and high quality simulation environments and situations which could powerful way generate positive change non threatening way because users can explore and play out situations they normally would not able real life unique that can completely immerse its users that provide the psychological experience being completely absorbed physical mental activity such that one loses sense time and the outside world immersion has been shown increase presence the physical feeling being the simulated environment which turn enhances the effectiveness the experience however the question remains how design for effective experience that can elicit positive mental well being there exists real life phenomenon that takes people into simulated world that feels completely real and might generate sense positive well being lucid dreaming lucid dreaming defined knowing one dreaming while the dream once lucid lucid dreamers have the ability explore shape create the environment they see fit lucid dreaming seems the ultimate virtual reality this respect because the lucid dreaming experience only limited onea imagination far these authors could find there does not appear any literature that focuses lucid dreaming experiences specifically inform the design virtual reality experiences conducted study nine active and proficient lucid dreamers interviewed the lucid dreamers about their experiences lucid dreaming particularly focusing lucid dreams involving introspection order answer the following research questions main question what are peoplea experiences introspection lucid dreaming sub questions what images sounds and other sensory stimuli are present during moments introspection lucid dreaming what are their relationships the feeling tonea and intensity the emotional stimuli how might these experiences inform the design immersive virtual reality introspective experience from these interviews drew four major themes that

contributions this work design considerations for introspective virtual reality experiences interviews with proficient lucid dreamers that ground technological systems human experience related work the work presented this paper intersects multiple fields builds positive technologies focusing virtual reality and incorporates the real life phenomenon lucid dreaming the context introspective practices these fields are briefly presented below positive technologies there has been recent importance put upon deigning for increased mental health and well being the hci community with new research areas evolving such positive technology and positive computing currently there exists several overlapping well being tech movements among designs and technologists which mossbridge has summarized review transcendence technology one focus this research user experience and recognizing the import ance considering the human condition when designing for technologies that how can design technologies that actively support well being and human potential this study seek ground design recommendations real human experience through interviewing very personal virtuala world lucid dreams virtual reality virtual reality defined the model reality with which human can interact getting information from the model ordinary human sense such sight sound and touch and controlling the model using ordinary human actions such position and motion body parts voicea has existed for decades though only recently that the latest generation head mounted displays hmds have become more affordable and accessible the general public moreover has the unique capacity completely immerse its users any environment component closely linked presence the feeling being the virtual space presence has been deemed central experience often used gold standarda having validity some researchers have argued that presence important goal transferring application data the real worlda could act medium through which people can increase their mental well being there exist high levels presence already has been used for therapeutic purposes such ptsd treatment anxiety treatment and pain management moreover has been used variety stress reduction and meditation mindfulness like applications clear that there potential for support well being however the way which designers and technologists create these experiences while keeping the human condition intact remains open question lucid dreaming lucid dreaming dreaming while knowing one dreaminga one phenomenon that can draw parallels experience genuine human experience that places person virtuala reality their dream which feels just real their waking reality the same time lucid dreamers are aware that they are dream and that nothing the dream has real life consequences much like that experience some researchers have dismissed the validity lucid dreams stating there was evidence lucid dreams were distinct from rapid eye movement rem sleep however several behavioural studies have since provided evidence that lucid dreams were possible more recently technological advances have allowed researchers record lucid dreaming with eeg emg eog and fmri psychophysical studies support the view that what people experience during rem sleep and lucid dreaming the same actually experiencing during waking life this means that lucid dreaming could used therapeutic tool because one can essentially anythi within the limits their imagination and that experience will have similar effects one experienced waking life the parallels lucid dreaming and are uncanny learning what enables lucid dreamers have such powerful introspective experiences might also learn some valuable guidelines for recreating similar experiences introspection one way lucid dreaming and thus could used therapeutic tool for introspection the examination observation onea own mental and emotional processes introspection can provide privileged access our own mental states including sensory bodily cognitive and emotional that are not mediated other sources knowledge that onea experience the mind unique and this can beneficial clinical and general sense moreover introspection can increase the quality and quantity information people have about themselves and break down the barrier the ego that affects how people process information about themselves many dreamers report that they use lucid dreaming for introspection such dealing with psychological issues spiritual growth and researchers have suggested that applications lucid dreaming could include night mare reduction treating depression and rehabilitation however learning the techniques lucid dreaming take time and discipline and one may not even experience lucid dream until month into keeping dream journal setting intention each night lucid dream and doing reality checks such checking how many fingers you have sporadically throughout the day additionally many people still feel skepticism towards lucid dreaming because dream report inaccuracy and its ties spirituality one could potentially induce lucid dreaming through frontal low current stimulation gamma activity chi paper chi april montra canadapaper page research group stimulated certain area the brain with transcranial alternating current and was effective the time giving naa participants lucid dreams however the mere induction lucid dreams ignores the many benefits that surround the practice lucid dreams and the ultimate goal being present aware your surroundings and ego waking life approachable ways introduce the concepts introspection are important generating true and genuine experiences with technology that can keep the human condit ion and experience intact propose investigating the experiences introspection lucid dreaming that can inform the design immersive technological system that can used tool for introspection order help people explore understand their internal states ultimately creating more positive sense mental well being study methodology the goal this study was describe the essence what like introspect lucid dreams the experiences gleaned from describing what like introspect lucid dreams and its context could useful for designing similar experience the format immersive technological system virtual reality participants interviewed nine participants who are currently active and proficient lucid dreamers laberge recommends the following when selecting lucid dreamers participants verify that informants understand the concept lucid dreaming requiring the inclusion recognition phrase sample lucid dream report and use highly trained participants who are skilful and accurate observers their conscious experiences entrance survey determined that the average time participants have been actively lucid dreaming years and the average frequency lucid dreams per week participants were the age majority where the research was conducted with average age years years range posted online advertisements social media groups facebook and twitter and lucid dreaming forums participants for this study were naa this study and did not have prior relationships order decrease any potential power imbalances and increase the validity their reports research site the interview took place quiet and undisturbed place where there were little distractions and the participant could focus the interview the interview was neutral location not create imbalance power between the researcher and the participant possible the interview was conducted place where the participant was comfortable and relaxed order create environment that allowed them open about their experience some interviews were conducted over online video conferencing for the participanta convenience data collection from quantitative perspective researchers are concerned with discovering facts about the phenomenon and assume fixed and measurable reality however the nature dreams especially the content dreams dynamic and negotiated reality this much better suited qualitativ methods which are more concerned with understanding human behaviour from the informanta perspective and does not assume fixed reality very difficult conduct research relating dream content for variety reasons most notably that cannot watch dreams while they are happening and the dreamer cannot report them while the dreams are happening therefore there way have objective evidence concerning the content the dreams some quantitative researchers have used neuroimaging techniques such eeg and fmri study which areas the brain are active during dreams however one could argue that this fundamentally different than collecting data what the dreamer actually perceives most dream researchers believe the best way study dreams through content ana lysis dream reports which can from sleep laboratories psychotherapy relationships personal dream journal and anonymous reports order gain rich understanding the phenomenon this research needs emphasize the context which introspection lucid dreaming occurred and the meanings these lucid dreams for participants using qualitative methods study lucid dreams and their experiences with introspection intended discover from the participants what kinds sensations feelings and experiences they had during introspective lucid dreams well the setting and conditions that lead their experiences fallman argues for philosophy technology hci building ihdea phenomenology relations between humans artifacts and the world and borgmanna suggestion rethink the relationship and correspondence between usefula and gooda technology this same line argument sought give new lens which provide guidance concerning how incorporate specific values namely introspection designing experiences phenomenology particular has direct relevance design several researchers have shown how phenomenology has been and can used both theoretical stance and research approach used semi structured interviews that lasted minutes one hour order discover what participants have experienced terms introspection lucid dreaming and what contexts situations have typically influenced affected these experiences this interview consisted three main domains natural attitude and life world apprehending the phenomenon modes appearing natural attitude and clarifying the phenomenon imaginative variation and meaning chi paper chi april montra canadapaper page interviews were audio recorded using the voice recordera app samsung galaxy smartphone quicktime built audio recorder order unobtrusive possible important that the tone and feeling the participantsa experiences also taken into account when analyzing the data due the very personal nat ure the phenomenon wrote reflection and debrief after each interview order capture any behaviours tone feeling impressions from the interview video recording could also serve the same purpose though unclear visual component will add anything the data and given the personal nature the study camera can feel more intrusive audio recordings the interview and interviewa notes were imported into nvivo for mac qualitative data analysis software and transcribed text all interviews were kept anonymous contact information was stored the universitya server the universitya institutional review board approved this study and the participants signed informed consent forms demographic questionnaire was administered online using fluidsurveys and was completed before the interview data analysis methods the method analysing data mentioned creswella qualitative inquiry and research design book was used for this study which essentially synthesis moustakasa and giorgia psychological phenomenologya here identified the main categories meaning units and composed textural description capture what the experience introspecting while lucid dreaming like for participants structural description the phenomenon and description capturing the essence the phenomenon finally used these descriptions inform design recommendations for introspective experiences virtual reality quotes are followed where denotes the participanta results from nine verbatim transcripts four main categories themes emerged across participants sensations and feelings actions and practices influences experience and meaning making next will discuss our findings for each these four main themes where will highlight key insights sensations and feelings experiences bodily sensations were prevalent lucid dreams relating introspection these senses mapped closely what participants had experienced waking life such touch smell taste sound vision and sense space there was sense clarity and heightened awareness the environment when participants became lucid their dreams lucid dreams were described visually vivid intense bright and graphic one participant even likened their dreams better than avatar film renowned for its cutting edge visual effects and psychedelic qualities better than avatara the thing love about the most that just get see the environment that love really rich thick kelp forests with sea dragons and cuttle fish and octopus fishing glowing neon lights visuals seemed the primary sense which participants experienced their lucid dreams and even without any other sense present they still felt like they were immersed the dream terms other senses lucid dreamers could smell taste and touch their dreams were real there was sense complete immersion the dream and the same time lucid dreamers knew was not actually real fact even though there were many inconsistencies the lucid dream such flying without wind sound without source hands with too many fingers this did not deter participants from accepting those inconsistencies and still having the feeling presence the real world there too were senses that could not explained terms our everyday experiences rather our language could not account for such experience that outside the realm anything have experienced before you don use your senses your dreams you have impression what the senses are like like eally distorted thing vision you can get into you can get lucid and you look out and you see somethinga that the sense are suppose the only way know the world now lot dream states are the only way you can reference you want see this and touch that and taste that and feel though some sensations cannot described the sensation around transitioning into the lucid dream straight from waking state was described detail they were able witness and remember the transition into sleep with all the bodily sensations that come with that experience here they describe imagining being boat the sea and remaining conscious their bodily state while the same time transitioning into this other world those secondsa could actually started hear the waves crashing the boat and just became more and more clear and could sort feel the boat moving the sea and could start see all the mountains appear but was weird because also felt body the couch was like was between two worlds and slowly time passeda could feel the vibrations sort feel myself the couch but was just drifting away and awareness started shifting into the boat and before knew maybe minute two was the sea like was clear day was like the real world but was actually just sitting couch the feeling realness and presence existed even with knowing they were still actually their couch visuals and vibrations were not immediately thrown this participant but rather there was build and easing into the dream chi paper chi april montra canadapaper page space this way transitioning was powerful for the participant that they felt awe the experience once they were the lucid dream their imagination had come life before their eyes terms emotions and affective states many participants reported positive feelings bliss happiness freedom peace lightness and childlike wonder and playfulness this particularly prevalent lucid dreaming experiences flying fact almost all participants reported that they often flew their lucid dreams because was fun experience something they could not real life and provided means letting any frustrations worries also have these feelings intense happiness and bliss and peacefulness and also exhilaration love flying and love being out control environment flying brought about feelings both peace and excitement perhaps from the flowing feeling from physically gliding through the air paired with the exhilaration superhuman like experience these lucid dreamers liked push the boundaries what possible and doing could experience something otherworldly that experience was powerful that could have positive influence lucid dreamera affective state another feeling lucid dreamers seem experience often was sense control over everything omnipotence empowerment and limitlessness participants reported that they could move objects with their mind and that feeling control gave them sense power just wake going like omnipotent love the telekinesis because just feels effortless well because lucid dreamers could control and manipulate the dream environment with their will they could create mould the experience their liking which was very empowering the experiences that lucid dreamers tended toward were often magical living out fantasy whatever that may for one participant this meant going grocery store and gorging their favourite foods foods they would normally restrict real life can eat whatever want went the freezer section because wanted freezer cake not like regular cake but whole thing freezer cake and then someone had bought calzone but then didn want eat was like front ate whole calzone ate mac and cheese there always mac and cheese whole foods when was eating bunch stuff and woke and was like that was exciting like that something wish could everything free whole foods and the carbs don affect blood sugar and whatever had field day from this account can see that lucid dreams were way for them experience something they would not normally able real life which may sometimes due physical restrictions moreover any experience lucid dream does not have real world physical consequences such caloric intake falling from great height swimming with whales lucid dreams provide afe and private space for people explore different sensations and feelings without fear judgment and this allows them really let and find sense peace and state non suffering actions and practices participants reported acting within their lucid dreams exploring creating playing problem solving and interacting with dream objects and characters exploring often involved nature such rocketing into outer space swimming with dolphins think for especially the ocean speaks volumes for reasons spent lot time and around the ocean and exploring child and love mean start off ecologist love the environment love nature and explore the terrestrial environment all the time but the ocean one that can really get waking life lucid dreamers could manipulate the dream space that they could explore facets the world unknown unreachable them but was not only physical spaces that lucid dreams could explore they could also explore the nature their own minds one participant recounted lucid dream which they attempted push the limits what was possible lucid dream counting down from ten order deepera the lucid dream what they found was dream scene greater perceived realnessa the realnessa the dream within dream seemed truly stay with this participant because they explained felt like deeper level being going even deeper this participant found themselves dream scene blood gore and violence which they interpreted going deeper into sub consciousness the more primitive parts human nature appears that exploring both physical and conceptual spaces large part the experience lucid dreaming for these participants some participants would also create lucid dream for example one participant described walking through gallery their lucid dream and seeing all these beautiful paintings they could not have possibly created hemselves but actuality was their own mind that created them can paint can paint whatever hopeless but there was period time when dreams when said you know want into gallery and want see paintings that gallery want them abstract want them beautifula wander through this gallery and see all these paintings sure could have painted them probably one the most successful painters the planet but they absolutely incredible mind has put them together for they chi paper chi april montra canadapaper page didn exist until saw them the gallery and asked for them there when went and saw incredible what the mind capable when test its limits and are space where believe anything possible such lucid dream one could the next picasso cezanne they were given the space explore and create without the limitations and impositions commonly placed them real life there was magical quality being the lucid dream space where the lucid dreamer was aware that all dream and the same time still received the psychological benefits having actually done experienced those things the dream lucid dream also provided the space for problem solving taking action the dream change into more positive experience for few participants was common have nightmares but rather than become frightened they became lucid and realized they could take control the situation either escape make into less frightening scene there was confrontation with the dream space itself and conscious decision change heir own mind into more positive state think was couple years ago was zombie dream was watching lot walking dead started off nightmare and then became kind fun realized that could hover above and wasn danger and could kind watch was happening like sometimes the dreams turn into kind like watching movie something entertaining and don want wake what participants how they interact their lucid dreams showed that they had some agency and sense control that was both empowering and fun lucid dreams were playful space explore and experiment within the safe confines onea own mind and was not only the contents the lucid dream that seemed important but also the practices surrounding lucid dreams almost all the participants reported some sort practice attempting increase their lucidity this included more systematic and scientific approaches such reality checks continuously questioning the nature reality real life hopes that when you were the dream space you would the same and realize you were dreaming taking supplements keeping dream journal and tracking bodily states reality checks were important establishing lucidity for participants because was one way being certain they were dreaming plugging your nose and attempting breathe there were more spiritual and ceremonial approaches well including lighting incense opening oneself the experience and letting the ego through meditation yoga and focusing the breath through mindfulness practices many these practices mentioned participants have been demonstrated help achieve lucidity the literature whichever method helping induce lucid dreams clear that there was some preparation ceremony surrounding the practice one participant spoke the importance ceremony going into lucid dream think ceremony probably most specific because lucid dreaming doesn mean anything you not using for certain reason right soa getting into the state ceremony because think ceremony teaches how and that guess probably even with technology like even just turning having make your bed something like that having time lay down having cushions comfortable all sorts ceremony right those states taking the time this get ready that are ready and can get into the state ceremony just tells your mind like getting into the state now something different not the regular pay attention and allow our spirit show setting intension and focusing attention seem have profound impact the level lucidity and ultimately the outcome the lucid dreaming experience rare that lucid dream will occur all one not creating habit ritual around much less the fanciful awe inspiring ones experienced the most dedicated and experienced lucid dreamer influences experience self awareness and focused attention lucid dreaming and the practices surrounding have commonalities with other introspective methods and often participants would using these other introspective methods tandem with lucid dreaming common practice reported amongst participants was meditation meditations that are like body scan deep relaxation type thing that like you know relax your head relax your shoulders doing that type thinga tried onea bilateral stimulation that what this called like ticking beat that alternates between your ears and its supposed tone used treatment for people with who have experienced trauma like helps people work through heal trauma somethinga felt more aware dream and don know linked that because thought would impact them something don know did but could remember specifically the morning dream that had after listening that meditation felt more aware being aware the present moment and focusing the body the most commonly reported type meditation amongst these lucid dreamers the practice lucid dreaming was about being aware reality what was real and what was not order gain lucidity and control over what was happening the dream space these two practices compliment each other both attemptin achieve greater awareness what was happening the environment and the self one participant even mentioned practice called dream yoga extension lucid dreaming only more spiritual practice founded chi paper chi april montra canadapaper page buddhism where one studies the mind using the medium dreams lucid dreaming the other hand does not have many spiritually oriented methods and thus might appeal wider audience one type meditation mentioned bilateral stimulation which could involve listening tones that alternate between the left and right sides the head and reported decrease physiological arousal and increase attentional flexibility decreased arousal and increased attention could linked this participanta lucidity dreams though they profess not sure this was placebo effect not negotiating with reality other experiences that seemed linked participantsa lucid dreams but were distinct experiences were the following out body experiences obes astral projections and false awakenings obes are defined perceiving the self outside onea body often from distance and are involuntary astral projections are like obes except they are voluntary finally false awakenings are vivid and convincing dreams that feel one has awoken yet the dreamer unaware they are still dreaming this contrast lucid dreaming where dreamers are aware they are dreaming while the dream all these experiences seemed either extensions side effects lucid dreaming practices that when one plays with perception and consciousness lucid dreaming practices sometimes the mind can turn that around and give the impression leaving onea body that one awake when still dreaming furthermore when one experienced lucid dreamer they can push the boundaries the dre further and things like out their own dream body there point where you can become body less you can extend beyond yourself you can lose your concept self you can dig deepera there place which call the void and you dream and from one dream another through mirror into another one and you get into what call pillar state where you have whole lack imagery but lot deeper say your watching thought before formed into anything just raw thought setting intention addition these related practices lucid dreaming these participants would often use psychology treatments conditions enhance make sense their lucid dreams one practice already previously mentioned was count down from ten similar hypnosis state consciousness where person more suggestible explicitly said they used hypnosis way hack your thoughts make yourself think how you want think order increase your confidence feel better these practices introspection like hypnosis seemed help with lucid dreaming because ability more suggestible space and suspend disbelief order experience accomplish the impossible cognitive behavioural therapy cbt was another psychological treatment mentioned participant that complemented lucid dreaming its ability look situation thought more logically was like the breaking down the disillusions cbt and looking things more logically that kind felt like how dealt with dreams you know when you not lucid everything illusion and you not reality until you think about logically you realizea everything figment imagination gaining control they were able use the techniques from cbt bring about sense clarity and heightened awareness their lucid dreams and doing had much richer and meaningful experience terms psy chological conditions one participant likened lucid dreaming psychosis mental condition characterized losing contact with external reality you this state where you can like with psychosis see reality and you can snap out but then that rational part your mind can reasoned with bit tried like this you know when you dreaming and you can suddenly realize you can control was describing the struggle becoming lucid dream where they were fighting their own mind take control the dream space they equated this struggle psychosis because their sibling experiences psychosis sometimes and perhaps was way for them relate and understand that condition but also way conceptualize what lucid dreaming was like namely was partly negotiation for control and knowing what was real all these experiences were separate from lucid dreaming but were nonetheless both related and had influence lucid dreams understanding these influences can begin determine what enhances the experience what are the prerequisites and what are its limitations from the accounts these nine participants seems like focused attention and self awareness both help enhance lucid dreams setting intention negotiating with reality and gaining control appear integral aspects lucid dreaming finally lucid dreaming can used experience your wildest fantasies can used rehearse situations solve problems however limited its ability deep and connect with the most inner aspects being for that you have meditation dream yoga astral projecting meaning making though lucid dreams cannot reach the deepest and most secret parts being they can still bring about authentic experiences and meaning was the case for all participants that they experienced some sort introspective experience shift change perception connection self others self growth from lucid chi paper chi april montra canadapaper page dreaming lucid dreaming for some participants could way gain access sub consciousness because their waking body was asleep described interacting with dream characters where they would ask these dre characters who they were and what they represented them the dream often there would answer the character would represent internal conflict aspect the self other participants reported interactions with dream characters well told story about lucid dream where they confronted dream character about why they felt sad and received response that they felt was reflection their own state being and the act acknowledging those feelings actually helped them better asked her what she felt bad about and she said inferiority said what would make you feel inferior she said other people asked her she didn feel inferior when she was alone she kind fell over sad and didn answer the whole thing made sad especially because why would this person who movie star feel bad inferior other people felt like crying few times guess this was someone who think really great but the same time they feel inferior anda think like the part that feels like struggles between feeling really good and feeling really bad about myself these dream characters did not only have human either talked about communicating and making friends with animals their lucid dream speaking with these animals was way for this participant connect deeper level speaking their best frienda doing might create sense positive well being another participant also experienced animals dream characters however this case was not much about being able connect different way the previous example but more allegory for their mothera passing mom was sick had her dog for while and had lucid dreams that this beautiful lady was kissing and would mean that dog would have pee saw this lady that encountered that was very beautiful and she was wrapped chains and she was saying let let and watched her cross the street she got hit car her guts were like all wrapped around hera took little while know what that vision was about here because forgot that see her the mother that lady who had been seeing not the dog feel like she was telling let her but think held little bit longer interacting with dream characters was one apparent and bold way seeking meaning lucid dream another was for one use lucid dreaming training grounds order build confidence the real world this could take the form confronting fear escaping nightmare and both had lucid dreams with zombies but were able apprehend the scary situation recognizing dream and laughing flying away would use lucid dreams way practice sports like snowboarding and try out different moves gain confidence them the real world this practice worked because the lucid dreaming space felt real felt like they were there doing another way gain confidence was something the lucid dream that one would not think was possible that one had never done before and through that experience one could learn and grow carrying that feeling accomplishment over the real world was sitting this concrete thing kayak attempting get over into the far pond and had jump and was like don know can this but then just gave myself confidence and just kind breathed with and managed this strange kind jump and was such moment that sat with for like the whole next daya because was like just that confidence confidence you know and actually hold that feeling even though the dream space was not happening reality and the participant was aware this fact the dream the experience still had effect their confidence long after waking and for few the participants this study was very powerful and overwhelmingly positive effect they had the ability take the dream for what was even with all its inconsistencies and bizarreness and make what they could from sometimes though diving into the depths onea mind revealed some fairly surprising and frightening aspects few participants ventured into the deeper parts their mind described dream space that they called the fielda which was electrical field energy that sent dreadful terrible sensations down their spine was lucid dream and wanted meditate which them meant getting rid the entire external environment and focusing themselves however this proved very intense experience because felt too black too isolating and too quiet completely alone with the self not really something most experience and when encountered that was too much handle the time also experienced very intense lucid dream where they wanted deeper into their mind like the dream within dream idea popularized the movie inception all around was lot blood and gore and violencea theory was that because went lot deeper into the subconscious was sort like saw more primal parts human nature and that was all the blood gore and violence lucid dreams were chance for the lucid dreamer actively search out experiences and draw meaning from them these dreams could symbolic carry meaning depending one wants them not some the participants were not interested finding meaning purpose but would rather have fun entertained others were very interested figuring out what the feeling chi paper chi april montra canadapaper page the dream represented find answers unlocking lifea secrets acknowledged this difference intent for lucid dreamers reflecting that peoplea own dreams can mean something not like black cat means bad luck but that dreams are very personalized and can draw meaning from them wish choose say means nothing all the point was that people make meaning they choose see something seemingly random and strange world dreams and that not nonsense that real feeling that lucid dreamers take with them into real life discussion the accounts introspection described luci dreamers are consistent with the descriptions control self healing and self awareness the literature here have identified four themes that center the essence what like introspect lucid dreams sensations and feelings lucid dreams involved what the lucid dreamer perceived and felt physically during their lucid dreams well what they felt emotionally during their lucid dreams actions and practices where ceremony was important surrounding the practices lucid dreaming involving exploration problem solving discovery and creation influences experience explained that many lucid dreamers had introspective practices and experiences such meditation connection nature and sense curiosity that has helped them gain greater awareness agency lucid dreams and meaning making where lucid dreamers had the opportunity deep within themselves analyse the content their dreams create their own meaning essence description lucid dreaming according the accounts our participants knowing you are dream while dreaming and then having the potential take control that dream and mould whatever fantasy situation feeling space one desires doing the lucid dreamer frees themselves from the laws and bounds waking life which feels very tranquil blissfula terms introspection lucid dreams there vividness and clarity that surrounds the experience the lucid dreamer can they please safe environment without judgement repercussions imposed the real world there chance explore onea thoughts and feelings and uncover secret knowledgea known only that individual lucid dreaming different and very personal for everyone and the same time the essence the phenomenon common across each the participants here for most the participants interviewed here could connection lens and way communicating with the self design implications there exist studies that have described the nature lucid dreaming but unique this study the specific focus introspection whereas prior studies investigated experiences lucid dreaming broader sense having participants provide detailed and rich descriptions their experiences with introspection lucid dreams provides data that can utilized generating design recommendations for virtual reality system that helps people with introspection with the ultimate goal improving mental well being corroborated results the sensations and feelings vividness and clarity generated through lucid dreaming practices could applied the context echoing prior work recommendations our findings show that visuals are very important the experience especially ones that are vivid because immerses the user the environment and ultimately creates the feeling realness other senses such sound taste touch and smell all contribute the experience which keeping with previous research yet any senses are missing somehow different from those experienced the real world then that does not diminish the experience because there acknowledgement that this environment not real and the same affordances and laws may not apply one implication this finding might that the strong focus graphical quality perhaps not important previously thought knowing that the environment not real does not seem important the immersiveness the experience itself moreover accu racy the environment does not seem necessary for the feeling realness either sufficient that there awareness the present environment these findings are supported previous work proposing that realistic experience longer immersive vra sole goal terms what users might like and how designers might approach introspection the lessons from our lucid dreaming participants are create experiences that give sense exploration and open environment where there the feeling possibility the experience should fun playful and childlike nature encourage exploration and wonder designers should consider the medium and think about what experiences people normally would not able the real world this may look like something fantastical such flying suggested mueller seeing another part the world people would normally not have access our reports from lucid dreamers indicate that some people may wish interact and change things the environment and others may not any case users should feel like they are control these interactions which generates feelings empowerment and confidence that can carry over into the real world this benefit bodily control was also found byrne and colleagues from our results found that the transitions and experiences surrounding experience are important creating safe environment without judgement repercussions imposed the real world for its uses explore the unfamiliar this finding supported patibanda and colleagues recommendation ease ina users for just our bodies are gently eased into sleep and into lucid dream seamless experience chi paper chi april montra canadapaper page too should the transition into and out the user aware that they are sitting their living room couch their office chair but they are invited into another world where they must suspend their disbelief that this all unreal and then open the possibilities that such world might offer make this leap easy possible designers might think about borrowing tools introspection from other domains such psychology spirituality and mindfulness these introspective tool teach awareness discipline considering another perspective loss ego and letting what think know possible these aspects are incorporated into the design introspective experiences then positive and outcomes like those seen from lucid dreaming might possible therefore when transitioning into think about the surrounding environment there seamless transition can the user feel safe enough let down their guard and truly immerse them selves the experience when transiting out there again the connection back the real world that eases the user between worlds and allows space for reflection nuanced insights ceremony around introspective experience lucid dreaming helps ease the transition into the dream space designers might also think about what ceremonies preparations the users are undergoing order prepare for them for the virtual world ceremony seems bring more meaning the experience because the person going into more mentally and physically ready and open the space the virtual environment itself might quite abstract feel empty and vast like some lucid dreamers reported while they meditated the dream nature theme lucid dreaming and also has close ties human connection including those aspects can help creating sense peace and awe furthermore abstract world gives space for the user provide their personal meaning and interpretation which important exploring onea thoughts and feelings uncovering secret knowledgea that personalized that individual and environment where the user bodiless can provide the right conditions for letting the ego the outer sense self and focusing inward these design considerations for introspective experiences taken from accounts lucid dreaming are promising because they echo those considerations already put forth the literature however these design considerations have presented here have not yet been put into practice though and lucid dreaming have many commonalities user experience may the case that there are other factors play that cannot account for providing introspective experiences for instance experiences are under complete control the designer whereas lucid dreams ebb and flow the spot depending the dreamera mental state until have reliable brain computer interfaces combined with then that one limitation the technology further research required test the validity our design considerations and eventually put forth more robust set design guidelines for introspective experiences virtual reality based human experience essential that this technology ground itself genuine experience order preserve the human condition conclusion virtual reality could the platform that allows its users explore introspection and have positive impact well being because its potential provide imm ersive space that feels real despite its user knowing not completely immersive experience draws may parallels real life virtuala phenomenon people already experience namely lucid dreaming using qualitative research methods study introspection lucid dreaming described the essence this phenomenon well the context which occurs the descriptions generated were used develop design considerations for immersive virtual reality system that will used tool for introspection from preliminary findings there are four themes sensations and feelings actions and practices influences experience and meaning making overall seems like lucid dreaming can used effective tool for introspection and can helpful new

being there participants and spectators interactive narrative ruth aylett and sandy louchart macs heriot watt university riccarton edinburgh ruth sandy macs abstract this paper considers the problem evaluating interactive narrative and discusses the storification process through which narrative internalised establishes the range roles that user may take and argues that the participant non participant distinction has key role storification experiment carried out part larger test double appraisal approach the creation more dramatic characters discussed the results show that spectators and participants mark different stories the most interesting showing that this role difference does indeed impact their assessment narrative experience the implications for story evaluation are discussed introduction this paper reports work carried out part investigation emergent narrative this mean the creation story like experiences real time using interactio between intelligent synthetic character generative mechanism the motive for this work attempt resolve what have described the narrative paradox which pre authored plot structures conflict with the freedom action and interactio character istic the medium real time interactive graphical environments the central idea that narrative experience can generated without specifying detailed plot advance then the user can alongside intelligent synthetic actors jointly take responsibility for the unfolding the story and the usera actions become positive contribution the narrative experience rather than potential obstacle argument against this approach that cannot guarantee narrative structure because allowing characters interact real time does not necessarily generate events that are experienced narrative one may respond this position number ways for example table top and live action role play stand empirical counter arguments given that these are precisely generated the role playing activity human participants supported and shaped the human game master one may also derive theoretical arguments from the game mastera pre game work designing storyworld and rich characters capable supporting the later jointly shaped narrative experience fruitful analogies can made with other art forms which pre authored structure and presentation time improvisation are combined number thc classical music pieces terry riley the progenitor minimalism one example being there participants and spectators interactive narrative presentedstory spectator characters external events gene rated story fig conventional narrative fig interactive narrative finally one may respond practically building and evaluating systems embodying the emergent narrative approach the fearnot interactive drama the theme educatio against bullying the last approach often seen the most convincing the proof the pudding the eatinga but raises further important question how can one tell emergent narrative successful there fact agreed evaluation methodology for interactive narrative general and formidable problems must faced deriving one narratology has taken analytical approach its field but analytical decomposition the story artefact rarely attempts answer the question how gooda story though may used post hoc theoretical justification for positive negative aesthetic judgment however both aesthetic judgement and supporting structural justifications are closely tied the existence single narrative artefact with separate phases authoring and presentation illustrated fig approach that invests heavily the concept audience whether reader spectator objective evaluative vantage point from which the narrative artefact can considered indeed classic view authorship incorporates such perspective the authora desired effect and while the more recent attac the priority author intentionality the foucaultian death the authora undermines this linking evaluative function between authoring and presentation phases anything puts still more emphasis the narrative artefact itself the texta once interactivity introduced this position becomes untenable our view interactivity means anything then the reader spectator must translated into the user for want more generally agreed term who from the conventional perspective able change the narrative artefact presented destroying its singular identity which then the artefact that evaluated one must move from narratology psychology and consider not the narrative artefact but the process through which the user engages with and internalises narrative experience process have referred storification figure illustrates the process oriented structure interactive narrative within this framework evaluation becomes subjective contingent and process oriented rather than objective universal and artefact oriented translatin this into computing terms the specific user experience and level satisfaction must considered argued the case faa ade aylett and louchart principle the storification process itself that ought figure evaluation though accessing course problematic participative nar rative and storif ication the literature narrative psychology focuses more the impact narrative has the overall psychology the subject and particular whether has lasting affective cognitive impact rather than the process storificatio itself however has increasingly been argued the recent period that narrative thinking represents fundamental structuring human experience both individual and collective and that the internalisation the individuala own past can represented memory holding stories about the self tempting see this perpetual storificatio individual life experience the roots external narrative way socially restructuring memory consequence taking autobiographic memory the basis for storification within narrative experiences distinct from ordinary life experiences stress the primacy the self and its own actio within storificatio the development theory mind tom which allows individual some sense put themselves the shoes someone else one way which the self oriented construction memory could extended into process engaging with the stories others the identificatio with story character that often felt spectator when they are narratively engaged might represent evidence this extension however the existence autobiographic memory more primitive structure supplemented tom order process narrative spectator suggests strongly that participating narrative experience might experienced quite differently from spectating putting into the context interactive narrative spectating puts the user into the meta narrative universe where participating forces them commit actions character within the narrative spectator characters are observed and tom used infer inner state for example emotion and motivation participant the motivation and emotion specific the character must felt least imagination order decide upon actio that the participating user experiences commitment act from evaluation perspective then story might have quite different impact storification and thus evaluation these two cases further angle this difference can derived from work systems thought originating analysis child development and learning bruner identifies three specific such systems enactive which child uses action manipulate objects iconic which child employs mental images which are primarily visual otherwise sensorily based and symbolic using language reasoning and other systems meaning participative narrative these three systems are coupled very closely the sense reflect act cycle required act the story world linked the perspective the specific role being played spectating role the input these systems thought quite different with much greater importance for perceiving and reflecting over range characters and little use enactive systems being there participants and spectators interactive narrative modes user engage ment having considered abstract the impact participation against non participation the story world seems worth examining the actual roles that users play relation the narrative experience here would mistake see interactivity narrative binary attribute rather than spectrum the non interactive end the conventional spectator audience the completely interactive end the participant user generative emergent narrative between one can distinguish different degrees coupling with the story world presentation time the table below lists intermediate positions this spectrum each which can seen specific software systems built researchers well other media table user roles across spectrum interactivity degree interactivity example none conventional audience spectator non participant control conventional authoring non participant influence forum theatre spect actors deus machina many god games participant control points branching narratives freely participating character larp emergent narrative non participant control merely the reverse side the audience spectator the author does not appear within the narrative experience but rather determines with control reaching variably down abstraction hierarchy from overall theme through abstract action sequences details character behaviour film the most extreme example given that the director may control even the detailed expressive behaviour actors through the use multiple cuts and editorial composition the final artefact multi media authoring typically also belongs this class non participative influencing allows the user retain the objective aspects the audience while simultaneously taking degree authorial responsibility for the overall narrative experience and typically interleaves interactive and non interactive phases covers variety forms which the user does not directly participate the narrative experience but nevertheless lacks full control over its unfolding either because events outside their control are simulated because characters have degree autonomy god gamesa such the sims are one example this user role but interesting variant can found the spect actors forum theatre here section the audience allocated character the unfolding drama the actor playing role and meets with them discuss what has happened the previous episode and what they ought the following episode the actor will take the advice their audience section unless conflicts with their role and also allowed halt episode seems that further advice needed version this approach was implemented the anti bullying fearnot system which episodes are aylett and louchart generated emergent narratives synthetic characters but the user interacts with victimised character between episodes and advises them also possible act non participant influencer generating events exogenous the characters that impact their goals and force planning for example removing resources required their current plan the game master role playing games may adopt either these approaches their use non player character well short participation since they are essentially disposable vehicles for influencing the human players specific ways branching narrative can seen minimally interactive form participation allows set pre authored possibilities navigated through decisio the user specific choice points thus isolating interactiv possibilities from non interactive story elements this distinction becomes very clear computer games which entirely scripted cut scenes are interleaved with interactive choices which may themselves not result much any narrative structure has however been used effectively pedagogically oriented systems where meeting educational objectives may require this degree authorial control the expense interactive freedom one moves from the interleaving interactive and non interactive narrative components branching narrative the emergent narrative framework interactivity becomes the determining influence the user experience for this reason there are principle many stories there are characters since when dramatic interest generated character interaction every character has narrative experience then definition participating user playing the role any character will have one experiment user role and evaluation have argued above that the participant and non participant roles result basic differences the storificatio process true then must taken into account evaluating interactive narrative since the invisible internal structures that are being evaluated may well differ order estab lish whether this practice conducted experiment using emergent narrative system based the fatima agent architecture used the fearnot application already mentioned see fig fatima autonomous agent architecture driven cognitive appraisal which generates internal emotional states using the occ taxonomy and links these coping actions generated both emotionally driven reactions and emotionally driven planning the detail this architecture not germane the evaluation reported here but has been reported elsewhere supports emergent narrative generated interaction between characters each with separately configured instance fatima their minda entirely new scenario was created involving group characters with sharply conflicting goals exploring egyptian pyramid that turns out eventually contain alien spaceship although graphical visualisation system can linked fatima characters was the case fearnot this instance text based visualiser was used avoid the considerable effort involved generating graphical assets being there participants and spectators interactive narrative fig the fatima agent architecture two variants the architecture fig were developed the first these characters were given the ability evaluate the emotional impact the set actions they were considering assuming that other characters would react they did themselves this involved relabelling actions events and running them second time through the agent mind they had happened the character rather than being carried out the character double appraisal approach this allowed the action with the greatest emotional impact chosen the second variant double appraisal was carried out using the actual minds other characters the scene possible graphical world not the real world different stories using this scenario identical set and initial character definitions are generated the system different occasions depending which fatima variant implemented the agent minds due the impact this has the actio selected characters further element indeterminacy added the stochastic outcome some physical actions that for example character who shot may killed may just wounded take these variatio into account and also order prevent the user interface design from affecting results the system was used exhaustively generate all possible versions single short scene used for evaluation this turned out produce five distinct stories the form sets language and non language actions the language actions were turned into text aylett and louchart hand manually applying standard templating approach used within fearnot the resulting stories number and number can seen below appendix previously mentioned the evaluation stories open research question date apart from interview based study for non implemented system kelso very little has been done order assess the intrinsic quality story much the evaluation work for interactive storytelling systems has instead been oriented towards character believability user interest replaying stories this study aimed provide results that robustly support comparison with other work the field and result sought establish the statistical significance those results the one way anov approach was selected from other possible statistica approaches generally suitable for tests with similar data ranges the ones this study the assumption was made that the differences between samples were normally distributed results have been subject analysis variance anov and are statistically significant range within the evaluation test batches the probability insignificance and degree significance are indicated for each result subjects carried out number ranking and marking exercises with the five stories which two are the subject this discussion the table below details the participantsa distribution table participant distribution male female total interactive non interactive experts non experts the evaluation plan designed for this application was composed different tests that aimed towards assessing the dramatic values the stories generated the system and aimed assess stories from spectator perspective presenting the user with set stories and asking them mark and rank them order preference although and displayed the same stories their test audience these were slightly modified that all stories contained the same amount actio and therefore were equal length this was establish whether the length stories plays role the marking ranking the user the actions used lengthen the stories did not influence the appreciation stories none them were reported being either interesting meaningful the final three tests and aimed asses stories from participative perspectiv and presented the users with role play making decisions for the game master and one character every cycle the user was presented with scenario situations and was asked make decisions which influenced the outcome the overall story therefore the users determined from their decisions the story they experienced these stories were also marked users note that the range non standard statistical measure however this approach suited the work carried out this study being there participants and spectators interactive narrative test subjects read the set stories generated the system test subjects played the role the colonel and took decisions for him both cases subjects marked each scale for dramatic interest and ranked them marked certain number actions for their meaningfulness scale marked certain number actions for their dramatic interest scale the results can seen fig below participation male female story marking comparision interactive non interactive storiesaverage markingnon fig non interactive and interactive marking stories stories and benefited from interactivity and presented interactive markings that are significantly higher than their non interactive counterparts the other hand stories and display the inverse trend story presents the best average non interactive marking but only scores joint fourth interactiv marking story presents the third best average non interactive marking but first interactive marking the effect participation against non participation clear this experiment though not all clear exactly what the stories causes this difference the colonel takes more actio story including killing one the party and may that having take the decision this increases the feeling responsibility for what happens the scene the part the user produces more highly emotionally tagged elements memory have not yet found any experimental work psychology that might clarify this finding but modelling memory has been done within fearnot characters though not within the scenario discussed here suggests that very different structures would result from carrying out such actio and from observing the results cited aylett and louchart however make clear that argued above the experience the user seen key evaluation criterion participative narrative must evaluated through participation and not through spectating conclusions further work this paper have reported initial experiment assess ing the impact participation interactive narrative its evaluation have hypothesized that this result related the differences the storificatio process would expect find these two cases especially relate storification the construction memory further search literature psychology required establish whether existing experimental work can help explain this result another avenue could explored incorporating memory into the characters comparing the changes character that carries out action and character that observes this approach may provide interesting indications the weight specific story elements might have the human mind but one must add that does not take account the element projectio and imagination the human engagement with narrative the user well aware that this indeed narrative and not real life the result the experiment described does however suggest very clearly that evaluating participative narrative observation likely provide very mislead ing results and that there alternative trying assess the experience the participating user

one that trulyrepresents him and that embodies this side himself alesser extent real life for many years eric avoided therapyof any kind had tried dii erent types treatment butwould not cooperate with his therapists the beginning thetherapy his parents reported that was opposed attendingthe sessions and that they practically had forcea him however during the sessions this form resistance was notfelt and eric cooperated well the therapeutic goal was helperic lower his anxiety level raise his self coni dence and formmeaningful social bonds the rst four sessions eric was proi cient creative workin and was clear that was familiar with the technology this seemed make easier for him make initial contactand continue receive treatment although according hisparents still did not want treatment this point after thei rst session where explained the therapeutic work toeric would enter the room with humiliated look put thehmd and create for the next min with short breaks would sometimes tell what had created but mostlyworked silently and watched his work from screen felt abit secluded and sometimes almost like peeked his work sincewe not see each other and not make eye contact thesesessions created aggressive content relating good bada and small large where most the small evil forces overcamethe larger benevolent forces the fth session worked asusual throughout the session but began talk and describe whatwas happening the characters during the creative process eric explained with his face covered the hmd that thisis iron man very strong wears silver mask and hasfrontiers psychology www frontiersin org february volume article fpsyg january time shamri zeevi making art therapy virtualblue eyes and you can see his eyes through the mask thissession eric insisted usual working creatively until theend the session and refused talk the end when his facewas visible and had eye contact the next session ericbrought small mask with him sat down front forthe rst time although his gaze still lowered and said that wasgiven the mask his parents when they had toured venice afew years earlier was much younger when they were awayand missed them very much but was afraid treateda like babya expressed his longing for them remainedsilent and played the computer his room mentionedthat since then has been wearing kind mask like wallbetween himself and his

created but call that ordinary man buthe has powers turn his body into iron the middle ofhis work and something happens turns himself into the ironman eric continued create the next few sessionswhen was already able take the hmd mask talk tome directly and even look straight from time time hedescribed follows man with many strengths buthis blue eyes are only for appearance after few more sessionswhen eric felt comfortable the clinic noticed white papermask the clinic placed the mask over his face and askedif could color started working with watercolors andcreated colorful soft maska for himself the same time eric casually mentioned that had connected with friend helikes from youtube his instagram account and him face face this was the start erica process ofgradually removing his iron maska and communicating withothers personal way and not only via his internet persona eric transitioned during the sessions between the and thetraditional art therapy spaces making connections betweenemotions and content also began make the his internet persona and the real world figure thetreatment ended after months when eric felt that his anxietylevel had dropped and that was able form

for liking interest and valence found that being interested modern art led higher liking and interest ratings for modem artworks but not for graffiti art conversely being interested graffiti increased ratings all scales for graffiti art but not for modem art also interest graffiti art had stronger effect valence ratings street context gray cubea than museum context white cubea therefore conclude

contextual experimental settings kirk fmri study revealed that participants rated the aesthetic value artworks higher when these were accompanied label stating they were artworks from art gallery than when they were accompanied label stating they were computer generated addition this contextual manipulation modulated activity the prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex indicating that these brain areas are biased prior expectations about the hedonic value the stimuli swami investigated the effect contextualizing information and different art styles aesthetic appreciation spea cifically found that content specific information enhanced una derstanding and appreciation abstract but not representaa tional artworks thus the influence contextualizing information depends the type information well the type artwork however the attributes artworks have changed during the century least since duchampa readymades and the emera gence pop art the objects cannot classified art according obvious criteria art and nonart can longer defined their visual propeities alone since artworks can look like virtually anything riggle hagtvedt and patrick demonstrated that the same images are evaluated differently when they were either presented work art illustration therefore adequate context features such the appearance art exhibition museum art gallery might required have intense aesthetic experience aesthetic experience all leder the other hand these specific contexts might not adequate for all types artworks for example graffiti and street art are typically not primarily found museums and art galleries but rather everyday street contexts while graffiti defined writa ing public walls dates back ancient history guthrie modem graffiti originated new york the late and early austin often characterized vandalism and viewed sign social disorder keizer lindenberg steg toet van schaik usually graffiti sprayer gets more credit for his her work the more conspicuous this obviously favors public places which turn increases the risk being caught graffiti therefore found more often side streets and other less frequented areas city reactions graffiti however seem vary considerably depending the type graffiti austin sanders and some instances graffiti can also viewed form art mcauliffe and iveson came the conclusion that graffiti maybe necessarily both art and crime emphasizing the unauthorized but also the artistic aspects graffiti austin even concluded thatillegally placing work public walls significant contribution even step forward for modem art much graffiti and street art are unauthorized and often illegal some them have found their way into the mainstream art market the works british street artist banksy for instance are sold high priced art compare for example the case one banksya murals that was removed from public wall london and appeared fine art auction with guide price siddique the term graffiti has broad scope and can also refer rather nonartistic scribbling writings public restrooms simple one color tags city walls which could still have some social significance and might therefore relevant for social but not for art related research the other hand street art explicitly defined riggle artistic style that makes use the street artistic resource that contributes essentially its meaning this view graffiti not necessarily but can street art although other labels such postgraffiti urban art have been introduced austin bou burnham for the sake simplicity here not distinguish between these terms and focus primarily their art aspects hereafter will therefore use the term graffiti art refer either graffiti street art similar artworks concerning the relevant context graffiti art riggle stated that notable feature street art that its meaning severely compromised when removed from the street simia larly austin wrote the city and its myriad writings are fundamental contextual references without which graffiti art poorly understood within graffiti art the city itself deployed artistic material hence hypothesize that both modern art and graffiti art require their adequate contexts correctly preclassified artworks and subsequently aesthetically apprea ciated however the type necessary context differs fundamena tally while for modern art the highly controlled white cube doherty museum art gallery seems adequate might not equally well suited context for graffiti art which commonly requires the context public urban environment sum argue that aesthetic experience influenced characteristics the artwork the viewer and the context our study analyze three aspects aesthetic appreciation liking interestingness and emotional valence interaction with intera personal factors like current affective state and specific art intera ests

embedded graffiti and modem artworks street and museum scenes shown the participants short videos that zoomed until only the embedded artwork filled the screen participants were instructed rate the artworks the three scales liking interestingness and emotional valence consistent with the assumptions that motivated this study found significant context graffiti interest interaction for the dependent variable emotional valence specifically graffiti ina terest had higher positive influence the valence scores the street context than had the museum context other words for those participants who were more interested graffiti emoa tions were more positive when graffiti art modern art was shown street context while this was much less the case museum context figure thus seems that participants with high interest graffitia who were presumably somehow accusa tomed actively view and enjoy graffiti art public placesa regarded street context more adequate for art than participants with low interest graffiti addition found significant style art interest interaction the models for liking and interest this means that both models art interest had higher positive influence the ratings modern art than had theratings graffiti art also found highly significant style graffiti interest interaction for all three models here graffiti interest had higher positive influence the ratings graffiti art than had the ratings modern art sum individual interest had higher influence the ratings the artistic style correa sponding this interest than the other style thus while the two interest scores are positively correlated they still not represent the same type interest but have rather specific influences the evaluations the corresponding type artworks for the other factors observed significant positive influence the panas score positive affect the liking and interest scores well significant positive effect graffiti interest all three dependent variables but main effect the experimental factors style and context thus when participants were more positive mood and more interested graffiti art evaluations were higher general art interest showed significant effect yet due the positive correlation between art interest and graffiti interest our sample this does not mean that art interest has significant influence the dependent variables only means that graffiti interest has significantly stronger influence than art interest the positive influence positive affect panas liking and interest scores line with the assumption that the affective state the beginning

was introduced capture the cognitive judgments the valence score informed about the emotional evaluations and the liking score was viewed summary evaluation comprising both aspects leder predicted these assumptions foundlarge correlations between the dependent variables liking and interest and liking and valence but somewhat smaller correlaa tion between interest and valence while our experiment aesthetic judgments and aesthetic emotions are related they neva ertheless seem correspond different aspects the aesthetic experience the finding that interest graffiti more important street context can also interpreted analogy the model aesthetic impression formation ritterfeld this model assumed that the social meaning object aesthetic interest decodable and consistent then this meaning serves heuristic and mostly the fit nonfit the social background the viewer that leads positive negative evaluations can probably assumed that street context kind social fit for gartus and lederpeople with high interest graffiti and therefore they tend award higher ratings for artworks this type context sum found that positive affect the beginning the experiment had positive influence the liking and interest scores but not the valence scores addition graffiti interest had positive influence general and also had stronger positive influence all evaluations graffiti art than had modern art likewise art interest had stronger positive influence liking and interest modern art concerning emotional evala uation graffiti interest had stronger positive influence street context than museum context that someone who gets positive emotions from graffiti art tends get even more positive emotions seeing other art street context compared with museum context the main goal this study was show how the context influences aesthetic evaluations modem art and graffiti art however did not find main effects style context nor significant style context interaction believe that this was due the randomized procedure and sequence trials more realistic everyday context one would instead see several pictures one context and then eventually change the context future studies thus should consider blocked presentations addition due the zooming procedure the context was not visible during the ratings this might have somewhat emphasized the context and might also have had impact the lack main context effect our findings suggest that appropriate context can indeed important for the evaluation different styles arta least interaction with the specific interests the viewers the white cube doherty the prototype todaya museum art gallerya minimizes outside influences which almost appears necessary condition for appreciating artworks however graffiti art which emerged public urban environments austin riggle seems require rather the graya cubes street context facilitate its aesthetic appreciation concerning practical implications our results our findings emphasize the role the context which artwork presented and how this shapes the aesthetic experience henkel moreover the individual interestsa interest art graffiti art specificallya are also considered thus taking graffiti arta works out their street context and putting them the white cube museum might not always the best way present them but least changes the way they are processed according our study graffiti does not necessarily become more aesthetic the museum context this has implications for the way art should presented for example graffiti art the museum could profit from references the context from designing the museum aca cordingly from extra information however the same might true for all kinds artworks and museum curators should aware that isolating aesthetic objects from their natural contexts affects how they are perceived thus while some context related effects the evaluation different styles art could shown this study further research still needed clarify the complex interplay artwork viewer and context related factors influencing aesthetic experiences addition further exhibition room arrangements and different urban environments well other art related contexts like books illustrations

adolescent erica treatment lasted months total was oriented art therapy because ofhis dii culties forming social relationships experiences ofanxiety low self esteem and academic dii culties school inthe rst few years school integrated well but and had outbursts and manifestations angerwhen did not get his way his free time eric enjoys playingcomputer games and watching television has active internet persona and popular youtubechannel that gets many likesa and provides him with platformto form meaningful connections with the world and his peers eric believes that his internet persona the one that trulyrepresents him and that embodies this side himself alesser extent real life for many years eric avoided therapyof any kind had tried dii erent types treatment butwould not cooperate with his therapists the beginning thetherapy his parents reported that was opposed attendingthe sessions and that they practically had forcea him however during the sessions this form resistance was notfelt and eric cooperated well the therapeutic goal was helperic lower his anxiety level raise his self coni dence and formmeaningful social bonds the rst four sessions eric was proi cient creative workin and was clear that was familiar with the technology this seemed make easier for him make initial contactand continue receive treatment although according hisparents still did not want treatment this point after thei rst session where explained the therapeutic work toeric would enter the room with humiliated look put thehmd and create for the next min with short breaks would sometimes tell what had created but mostlyworked silently and watched his work from screen felt abit secluded and sometimes almost like peeked his work sincewe not see each other and not make eye contact thesesessions created aggressive content relating good bada and small large where most the small evil forces overcamethe larger benevolent forces the fth session worked asusual throughout the session but began talk and describe whatwas happening the characters during the creative process eric explained with his face covered the hmd that thisis iron man very strong wears silver mask and hasfrontiers psychology www frontiersin org february volume article fpsyg january time shamri zeevi making art therapy virtualblue eyes and you can see his eyes through the mask thissession eric insisted usual working creatively until theend the session and refused talk the end when his facewas visible and had eye contact the next session ericbrought small mask with him sat down front forthe rst time although his gaze still lowered and said that wasgiven the mask his parents when they had toured venice afew years earlier was much younger when they were awayand missed them very much but was afraid treateda like babya expressed his longing for them remainedsilent and played the computer his room mentionedthat since then has been wearing kind mask like wallbetween himself and his surroundings eric asked scanthe mask into the digital software began reducing andenlarging the mask and then incorporating into his work hethen explained the mask isna actually made iron the ironman created but call that ordinary man buthe has powers turn his body into iron the middle ofhis work and something happens turns himself into the ironman eric continued create the next few sessionswhen was already able take the hmd mask talk tome directly and even look straight from time time hedescribed follows man with many strengths buthis blue eyes are only for appearance after few more sessionswhen eric felt comfortable the clinic noticed white papermask the clinic placed the mask over his face and askedif could color started working with watercolors andcreated colorful soft maska for himself the same time eric casually mentioned that had connected with friend helikes from youtube his instagram account and him face face this was the start erica process ofgradually removing his iron maska and communicating withothers personal way and not only via his internet persona eric transitioned during the sessions between the and thetraditional art therapy spaces making connections betweenemotions and content also began make the his internet persona and the real world figure thetreatment ended after months when eric felt that his anxietylevel had dropped and that was able form number ofsocial connections should noted that the same timehe did not part from his internet persona and continued tocultivate well figure erica iron man frontiers psychology www frontiersin org

thatwith sharevr could increase enjoyment for non hmdusers for located asymmetric experiences similar enjoyment signii cant differences were foundusing the geq behavioural involvement subscale this canbe explained with the strong effect each individual game had the geq measures how much playera actions depend onthe other player this was fact very different for both gameswhich might have had more impact participants than thesystem used however when rating only the systems regardinghow engaged they felt with the other player signii cantly higher rating using sharevr for bothhmd andnon hmd players explain these ndings withthe aspect the shared physical space when wearing anhmd users are visually isolated from the space around them even playing with another user located the couch notactually seeing the other reduces the experience online gaming this was similarly mentioned byparticipant the projection helps part the experiencebut using the controller felt more like playing online sinceyou dona share any physical spacea this further shows howsharevr not only positively impacts the overall hmd users but also for hmd users compared the baseline sharevr overall signii cantlyincreased the presence the non hmd user measured thesus questionnaire and the nal comparison interestingly inthe nal comparison participants rated non hmd xsharevr only slightly lower than playing with hmd the baseline this suggests that sharevr did fact improve presence overthebaseline further might even possible that the systemcan elicit presence the non hmd player that comparableto playing with hmd summarized found that sharevr did improve enjoyment social engagement and presence over the baseline condition unsurprisingly found several effects playing hmdornon hmd player well effects from the this suggests that although sharevr showedpromising results experiences have specii cally designedfor the located asymmetric approach therefore the nextsection going focus the design space sharevr design space and guidelinesto gain deeper understanding the design space itsimplications and able derive design conducted second smaller exploratory study with twogroups participants the main goal was furtherexpose participants with the system and observe behavior andinteractions using sharevr exploratory studywe invited two groups three participants each into our laband let them experience approximately minuteslong gaming session with the sandbox application see videofigure participants were again recruited group with astrong social bond and enjoying playing together the rstrecruited group were three male hci researchers age and the second group consisted three male vrenthusiasts age after short the control mechanics sharevr participants were freeto explore each application and had further restrictions ouronly request was that each participant should experience eachpossible role hmd non hmd and observer the couch afterwards conducted semi structured group interview onaspects sharevr each individual role and the during the study three the authors were presenttaking notes about observed behaviour and the group after both sessions the three authors had oneshared coding session thematic analysis which notes werecompared and themes identii and discussed additional findingsthe overall ndings were directly integrated into the and the design space this part will briei ygive insights ndings not covered these two sections butseemed noteworthy non hmd users tend form certain bond with the observersince they both experience similar perception the virtualworld and the hmd user participants often teased the hmduser with his inability seeing the physical space pokewith not tracked ini ated sword nevertheless hmd partic ipants reported feeling safe when immersed not bump intothings and walk out the tracking space since two non hmdusers were around watching out for them this shows that bothaccepted the teasing part the individual game without anegative ini uence the whole experience further served several occasions where the hmd user made group laughter that started simultaneously thisshows that everyone was fully capable understanding what isgoing the scene participants further reported they felt asthey were entertaining the observer the couch and that thisfeeling could potentially higher there would several peo ple the couch terms experiences participants reportedthey had fun every role but would prefer games which are notbased activities they can experience real life soccer design spacein the following will present four variables the designspace identii essential factors and explain this categorization based insights wegained from actively implementing and testing sharevr andboth user studies asymmetry visualization and interaction the main variableof every experience implemented for sharevr the level ofasymmetry visualization and interaction the starting situ ation already has strong asymmetry terms visualization since the hmd user has stereoscopic perception the virtualworld and the non hmd user gets his understanding theworld through displays both have inherent advantagesand disadvantages and should considered when for both users see rst guideline the goalhere not bring both the same level but leverage theadvantages each individual visualization when done right high degree asymmetry can lead two entirely which results high replay value dependency the level dependency how much coordination necessary between hmdexperiences with virtual realitychi may denver usa andnon hmd user achieve goal dependency mustbe controlled and balanced collaborative and too high degree dependency will slow down theoverall gameplay but too low dependency results bothplayers having two separate experiences each user something the games progress leveraging theadvantage their modality non artii cial form not jobcreation schemea bemylight used several iterationsto balance the dependency such way that both users feltthey played vital role for the progress the game power distribution throughout our work with sharevr weobserved that the power level one has over the other user orthe virtual environment highly ini uenced the enjoyment ofthe experience the more can impact the virtual environmentor the other user hit him with sword the more enjoythe experience hereby not necessary fully balance thepower between both users since users mostly wanted haveboth experiences and will switch roles eventually throughoutour study participants were always aware this switch ofroles and therefore restrained themselves from over using theirpower however for collaborative experiences the power levelshould equally balanced that both users have feelingof playing vital role the progress the game physical proximity each individual experience the allocation the tracking space between hmdandnon hmd users the physical proximity embeddedas part the virtual experience can potentially lead anincrease presence for the hmd user however perceived acoustically tactile can breakthe presence and immersion for the hmd user see fourthguideline general observed that participants enjoyed ahigh level physical involvement and were able coordinatetheir position inside the tracking space easily here greatadvantage have non hmd user inside the tracking spacesince was mostly charge the coordination guidelinesfrom both studies and our own experience derived fourguidelines which consider essential when designing forasymmetric located experiences such sharevr leverage asymmetry instead assigning irrelevant tasks tothenon hmd user create any form dependence and leverage the inherent advantages each role offer isometric orthogonal visualizations the non hmduser since those help perceive spatial relations the virtualscene and allow the non hmd user engage with the couch design for the whole living room create visualizations notonly for the engaged non hmd user but keep mind thatmore participants can around actively decided usean orthographic camera for the projection and not viewdependent which could easily adapted for the position thenon hmd user but only work from his perspective includeas many observing roles you wish your application butkeep mind that non hmd users may tend team withobservers against the hmd user physical engagement fun moderation throughout ourwhole experience with sharevr participants both hmd andnon hmd users highly valued the ability physically engagewith each other introduce physical props which you can eithermount onto one controller track otherwise those can highlyincrease the presence the hmd user but careful ofphysical engagement which not visualized transparent tothehmd user since this can result discomfort design for mixed reality shared physical space keep inmind that your players are both located the same physicalspace but perceive two different realities even you notvisualize the movement and actions your non hmd user thehmd user will hear him interact the surrounding insome cases this can break the presence and immersion thehmd user hearing footsteps while his character visuallyi oating but when considered the game design can enhancethe experience for both physical props positioned thenon hmd user inside the tracking space conclusionin this work presented sharevr proof concept proto type

subjective factors the results the ear lier pilot experiment strongly suggested presence and the dominant representation sys tem the subject elicited from content analysis ofessays written them after

correlated with increasing visual dominance andnegatively correlated with increasing auditory domi nance for those subjects who had virtual body self representation the kinesthetic modality was with reported presence whereas for thosewho had self representation arrow cursor the presence volume number kinesthetic score was negatively correlated with pres ence the analysis also suggested

criticism into account how ever the visual cliff and virtual actor events always curred the end the session that they would bemore likely remembered and effective influenc ing the final state the subjects should also noted that although the gravity sual cliff and virtual actor variables did not show assignificant this could well consequence the mea surement presence used can argued that subjectshave certain baseline level presence the andthe questionnaire may lead expectation that are looking for answers that are beyondthis baseline for example almost all subjects carefullyavoid collisions with virtual objects even though intellec tually they know that there are real obstacles couldbe the case therefore that the majority subjects mostof the time experience strong sense presence but donot exhibit even later report this because most thetime nothing out the ordinary happening theydo react virtual actor that walking toward them show visible reactions when over the virtual precipice this because such dramatic events call forth visibleresponse thus important distinguish betweensigns presence such reactions extreme events oreven the matching the real left hand

only few studies have examined the relation between and viewing time with regard the perception art research art museums showed that the number artworksin exhibition room affects viewing time viewing timecommonly decreases over the course the exhibition aphenomena calledmuseum fatigue for overview see and the average time spent viewing artworks generally short smith and smith recorded how long people viewed six thepaintings the permanent collection the art containing over million objects they reportedplos one www plosone org june volume issue median viewing time seconds mean seconds around percent the looks lasted less than seconds onequarter one third the looks lasted around half minute andonly percent the looks lasted longer than minute moreover mean viewing time significantly differed amongartworks and participants suggesting that both artwork and personal characteristics affect viewing time however smith and smith performed their manual chronometry and they did not collect data aboutpeoplea subjective experience each artwork heidenreich andturanoa study aimed overcome these limitations theyanalyzed the correlation between viewing time and art experience and they measured viewing time and eye movement patterns witha head mounted eye tracker while participants solely viewed selected artworks exhibited museum participants were askedto rate each artwork pleasantness interestingness beauty power clarity and orderliness similar smith and smith theyfound large individual differences with viewing times ranging from seconds surprisingly however viewing time did correlate with any the art experience scales thiswould imply that contrast other types visual stimuli viewing time for artworks not related subjective experience however due the small sample size the these results limited and has taken with caution nevertheless these museum studies suggest that average viewingtime for artworks around seconds with large variationsamong people and artworks the relation between viewing timeand the experience art however remains unclear context and the experience artart always experienced specific context the semanticcontext created providing certain

number exhibited artworks probably reducedaverage viewing time differences the experience art between contextsthe appreciation art differs between the museum and thelaboratory context our study artworks were liked more andfound more interesting the museum context the otherhand the evaluation ambiguity did not differ between contextsand the sense understanding only tended higher themuseum this suggests that the museum context those aspects art experience that are more closelylinked with emotion liking and interest although most studiesthat investigated emotional experiences during art perception wereactually conducted the laboratory context our that emotional responses art may stronger moreusual settings our results are well line with previous findings whichreported higher interestingness and pleasantness ratings fororiginal artworks the museum compared digital reproduc tions presented laboratory computer screen nadal brieber and leder obtained similar results using within subject design and also found that artworks the museum wereliked more found more interesting and experienced morepositive and arousing thus although these studies wereconducted several museums using different artworks anddifferent experimental designs between and within subject theyall support the notion that there enhanced art experience inthe museum among several factors that might contribute this enhancedart experience the museum peoplea aesthetic attitude whilebeholding artwork and the authenticity the artwork itselfmight play decisive role the museum context enhances theartistic status the exhibited objects and consequently facilitates the adoption aesthetic orientation associated withincreased affective processing the museum visitors with anaesthetic orientation encounter genuine artworks authenticity isan important factor increasing the monetary value andaesthetic evaluation art remains unclear however whether the physical context the authenticity the artwork aninteraction between them determines the enhanced art experiencein the museum therefore further studies are required todisentangle the effects physical context and authenticity artexperience context modulates the relation between art experienceand viewing timeour analyses demonstrate that there relationship betweenpeoplea experience art and how much time they choose viewart and reading the labels furthermore the relationship betweenviewing time and art experience was modulated context thesecontext effects show that over and above quantitative differencesin viewing time and art experience between contexts under laboratory conditions are not necessarily trans ferable other settings additionally building researchwhich found that art specific information affects appreciation our analysis predicting viewing time for labels offers anexplanation which factors actually drive information seeking hereafter discuss how the predictors main interesta appreciation ambiguity and understandinga affect viewing timefor artworks and labels both contexts viewing time for artworks and labels increasedwith appreciation liking and interest the strength however tended vary with context peoplea sappreciation showed slightly stronger relationship with viewingtime for artworks and labels the laboratory than the museumcontext thus appreciation based liking and more important predictor viewing time thelaboratory than the museum context this suggests that longerviewing times for artworks the museum context cannot beexplained enhanced appreciation alone additional factorssuch ambiguity need considered has been argued that ambiguity important aspect ofaesthetic experience our results showed however that theeffect ambiguity time spent viewing artworks between contexts while there was positive relationbetween ambiguity and viewing time the museum participantsin the laboratory showed negative relationship this isparticularly interesting relation the finding that participantsin the museum and the laboratory did not differ how theyevaluated ambiguity thus although peoplea experience ofambiguity might similar different contexts its impact onpeoplea viewing behavior differs the museum context promotesthat people engage with and delve into the ambiguity artworksand invest more time resolving while the the point time where people decide refocus theirattention another artwork comes sooner for the moreambiguous artworks therefore the museum context changeshow ambiguity affects peoplea exploration behavior similar the effects appreciation understanding predicted viewing time for artworks both contexts increased understanding was related increase viewing timefor artworks however the subjective impression artista work was not related the time people spent onreading the labels this surprising because text labels supposed assist the beholder infigure relationship between viewing time for labels and artappreciation context relationship

graphical sociopolitical context especially with respect tocontemporary art the need for commentarya should verystrong therefore accordance with previous research onthe effect information understanding expected apositive relationship between understanding and viewing time forlabels one possible explanation for our finding could that thelabels this exhibition were not informative enough and thus people did not benefit from reading thetext information the lack the relation between viewing time for labels however remains unclear and needsfurther studies our general finding that art experience positively related toviewing time differs from heidenreich and turanoa who didnot find any significant correlations our analysis suggests that artappreciation less strongly related viewing time the museumthan laboratory context given that heidenreich and turanocollected their data the museum with small sample only likely that these differing findings occur becausetheir analysis was underpowered most studies the field empirical aesthetics thecurrent study only recruited psychology students whose see the artworks uncertain this homogeneous samples with regards factors such asage socioeconomic status and education and facilitates thecontrol the level art expertise nevertheless further studiesshould conducted with spontaneous art museum visitors raise the level ecological validity and enlargeour knowledge about art experience the museum aesthetics has mostly focused how stimulus orpersonal factors contribute the appreciation art our that context affects the experience
